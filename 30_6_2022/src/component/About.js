            <h3> Vision Statement</h3>
            <h6>
                A vision statement presents the organization’s optimal goal and ultimate reason for existence. For example, Google’s vision statement is to “provide access to the world’s information in one click.” IKEA’s is to “create a better everyday life for many people.” If you’re comfortable with traditional business terms, vision statements are “top of the funnel.” They’re broader statements that represent a large overall goal or aspiration. They’re sometimes considered the legacy your company hopes to leave behind.</h6>

            <h3> Mission Statement</h3>
            <h6>
                A mission statement is the overview of how the organization will reach its vision. Google’s mission statement is “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” The idea of organizing the world’s information (contained in the mission statement) supports the idea of providing access to the world’s information (contained in the vision statement). IKEA offers “a wide range of well-designed, functional home furnishing products.” This supports its vision of creating a better everyday life for many people.</h6>
